List of accounts worth blocking on Twitter

I'm tired of toxic accounts on Twitter. So I block them. But that doesn't do much besides keep them out of my timeline. I'd like to help other people by banding us together to enmass block the accounts that should have been banned.

Here's how to import this list into your Twitter: https://support.twitter.com/articles/20172663

If you'd like to add accounts to this list, either submit a pull request, or simply send me a message.

Here is the current list:
